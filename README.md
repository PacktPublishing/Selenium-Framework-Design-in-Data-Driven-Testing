# Selenium Framework Design in Data-Driven Testing

This is the code repository for [Selenium Framework Design in Data-Driven Testing](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/selenium-framework-design-data-driven-testing?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=9781788473576), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book

The Selenium WebDriver 3.x Technology is an open source API available to test both Browser and Mobile applications. It is completely platform independent in that tests built for 1 browser or mobile device, will also work on all other browsers and mobile devices. The technology supports all major development languages which allow it to be tied directly into the technology used to develop the applications. This guide will provide a step-by-step approach to designing and building a data-driven test framework using the Selenium WebDriver, Java, and TestNG technologies.
Users will learn how to design and build a Selenium Grid from scratch to allow the framework to scale and support different browsers, mobile devices, versions, and platforms, and how they can leverage third party grids in the Cloud like Sauce Labs.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter01.



The code will look like the following:
```

    if ( instance == null ) {
            instance = new CreateDriver();
        }

        return instance;
    }

```
